In "Cabbage," I developed an Android app using Firebase for user authentication and real-time data storage. Users can create and share posts, stored in a Firebase database, and view them in the second activity's ListView. The app includes features like user login, logout, and navigation between activities. Overcoming challenges such as UI design and data retrieval, I adapted ArrayAdapter and Firebase queries to ensure a smooth user experience. "Cabbage" aims to foster collaboration by providing a platform for seamless information sharing among users.
